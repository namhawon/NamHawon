## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**Good day! My name is *Hawon Nam*,
and I am deeply interested in Child Development & Family Studies as well as Psychology!**

My studies have provided deep insights into supporting children with special needs and the elderly. This background has sparked my interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics, focusing on how they can assist those who feel socially and emotionally isolated. I believe that AI and robotic technologies have the potential to provide emotional support and help reintegrate these individuals into society.
